# Internetional Clothing size chart conversion (jQuery)
Because the size specifications of clothes in different countries are different, such as US / CA and EUR / FR / ES are inconsistent, and some use S/M/L, so I wrote a conversion of clothes international size chart, the interface is simpler and easier to understand.
# Included functions
1. Inch and cm conversion
2. Sizes of different countries
3. Simple css layout
4. Use localStorage to store user behaviors, so that users can keep the same data when browsing another pages which use this widget.
