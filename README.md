# clothing-size-chart-conversion
Because the size specifications of clothes in different countries are different, such as US / CA and EUR / FR / ES are inconsistent, and some use SML, so I wrote a conversion of clothes international size units, the interface is simpler and easier to understand.
# Included functions
1. Inch and cm conversion
2. Sizes of different countries
3. Concise css layout
4. Use localStorage to store user behaviors, so that users can maintain unified data when browsing multiple pages
